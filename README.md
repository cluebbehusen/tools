# tools

A collection of LLM-generated (Claude Code, Codex CLI, etc.) single-file HTML applications, deployed to `tools.luebbehusen.dev`, and inspired by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/).

Each tool is named with a unique slug and contains a documentation file at `<tool name>.doc.md`. Tools are aggregated in `tools.json` and rendered on the main `index.html` page.
